# DETECT v2

A [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) webapp and command line evaluator over the DETECT v2 SysML v2 models in `model/`, using [Syside Automator](https://docs.sensmetry.com/automator/). It covers the three use cases the models declare: ecosystem sizing, tool types by lifecycle phase, and tool types by job series.

The models are the source of truth. Use cases, questions, answers, help text, lifecycle phases, job series, criteria, requirements, their ordering and tool mappings are all read out of the models, so extending DETECT means editing the models rather than the Python.

## Running it

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then:

```sh
uv sync
uv run python webapp_main.py      # webapp at http://localhost:8080, or on $PORT
uv run python detect.py           # command line, writes CSVs to Output/
uv run python -m pytest tests/    # tests
```

Syside needs a Pro licence as soon as it is imported, so all three commands need one. Provide it through one of these environment variables:

- `SYSIDE_LICENSE_KEY`, holding the key itself
- `SYSIDE_LICENSE_FILE`, holding the path to a `.lic` certificate

For a trial licence, see [syside.sensmetry.com](https://syside.sensmetry.com). Keep the licence out of this repository; `.gitignore` excludes `*.lic`.

Running it this way needs no Docker.

The evaluator loads every `.sysml` file in `model/`.

The command line path reads your answers out of the model files themselves: set the sizing attributes in `model/sizing_input.sysml` away from `TBD`, and set the boolean flags in `model/lifecycle_phase_input.sysml` and `model/job_series_input.sysml`. The webapp writes the same answers into an in-memory copy of the model instead, so it leaves the files alone.

### Optionally, in a dev container

`.devcontainer/` describes a VS Code dev container with Python, uv, the dependencies and the Syside extension installed. Using it is optional, and it needs two things the steps above do not:

1. Docker. On Windows or macOS, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/); on Windows it also needs WSL 2, which its installer sets up. On Linux, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Docker Desktop requires a paid subscription for use in larger organisations and in government; see [its licence terms](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/).
2. The VS Code [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.

Set `SYSIDE_LICENSE_KEY` on your machine, start VS Code from an environment where it is set, then run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**. The container reads the key from that environment.

## What it produces

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements.csv` | `id`, `value`, `description` — ecosystem requirements applicable at the calculated size |
| `criteria.csv` | `id`, `value`, `criteria`, `context` — tool evaluation criteria applicable at the calculated size |
| `uc2_tools.csv` | `tool_type`, `required_by` — tool types required by the selected lifecycle phases |
| `uc3_tools.csv` | `tool_type`, `required_by` — tool types required by the selected job series |

The tool type files are named after the use case's short name in the model, so a fourth use case gets its own file without a change to the Python. The `value` column is the weight the model assigns, rounded to four decimal places on output only.

## Layout

- `model/` — the SysML v2 models, which are the source of truth.
- `detect.py` — the evaluator, and the command line entry point. Nothing here reimplements a filtering rule, a weight or a tool mapping; all of it is evaluated from the models.
- `webapp_main.py` — the webapp: a landing page, a configuration page with one tab per use case, tables and CSV downloads.
- `README_web.md` — the text of the landing page.
- `tests/` — tests over the evaluator, run against the models in `model/`.

## Container image

This section is only for deploying the webapp; running it locally does not need it.

```sh
docker build -t detect-webapp .
```

Dependencies are managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `pyproject.toml` declares them and `uv.lock` pins every package by version and hash. The image installs with `uv sync --frozen`, which fails rather than silently relocking.

The image contains no licence. `SYSIDE_LICENSE_FILE` points at `/secrets/syside-license.lic`, which is expected to be mounted at runtime, for example:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/syside-license.lic:/secrets/syside-license.lic:ro detect-webapp
```

Do not pass the licence through an `ENV` instruction or a build argument: those are recorded in the image and can be read with `docker history`. `.dockerignore` excludes `*.lic` from the build context for the same reason.
